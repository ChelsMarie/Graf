<p>
  At the top of the page you'll see the toolbar. There are multiple tools to select
</p>
<p>
  The default tool is the Select tool, which can be used to select the nodes and edges on the graph. 
</p>

<p>
  Use the Node tool to add nodes to the graph.
</p>

<p>
  The edge tool can be used to add both directed and undirected edges.
</p>
<p>
  The label tool can be used to label nodes and edges.
</p>
<p>
  The erase tool is used to erase nodes and edges.
</p>

<p>
  The algorithm tool is used to apply algorithms to the graph, such as Dijkstra's algorithm.
  Simply select two nodes with the select tool, then select which algorithm to apply.

<h4>
  An important note about the Maximum Flow Algorithm...
</h4>
<p>
  The weight of an undirected and a bidirected edge must be two numbers separated using the '/' character, such that the number to the left of '/' is the weight of the outgoing edge, and the number to the right of '/' is the weight of the incoming edge.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if the user adds an undirected or a bidirected edge by selecting node 'a' first and node 'b' second, and changes the edge weight to "3/6", then the edge from node 'a' to node 'b' will have weight 3, and the edge from node 'b' to node 'a' will have weight 6.
